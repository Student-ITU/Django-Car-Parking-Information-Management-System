/*Student Attendance Tracking System:

A school wants to develop a program to track student attendance efficiently. Write a program to assist the school with the following tasks:

Record Attendance:

Allow teachers to record the attendance of students for each class. Each attendance record should include the student's name and whether they were present or absent.
Attendance Summary:

Implement functionality to generate an attendance summary for each class. The program should calculate the total number of students present, absent, and the overall attendance percentage for each class.
Attendance Analysis:

Allow school administrators to analyze attendance data over time. The program should calculate and display trends in attendance, such as the average attendance rate across all classes and the classes with the highest and lowest attendance rates.
Attendance Alerts:

Enable the system to generate alerts for students with low attendance. If a student's attendance falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 80%), the program should flag them for intervention by school counselors or administrators.*/
